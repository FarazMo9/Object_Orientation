# Object_Orientation

The title itself means to try for viewing everything and any entity as an object. When you imagine an object, there will some concepts which are related to the structure of an object.
The object-oriented paradigm contains multiple concepts like encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.

Encapsulation 
The purpose of “Encapsulation” is for separating the implementation details and internal behaviors of an object from outside of it. For example, imagine a class named “Calculator” which has a function named “GetRandomNumber” to prepare a random number between the two numbers which are sent as parameters. When the app requests the function, the operation is not clear for that caller of the function. The only thing which it wants is the output base on the inputs.

Inheritance
This concept is so useful in object-oriented programming. Base on the meaning of the word “Inheritance” itself, there is a parent with some properties which they will be exist for its children. So, the parent is an object and the children are also objects that have the parent’s properties and behavior. The child can have the custom properties and behavior. 

Polymorphsim
The feature of “Polymorphism” means to have a function which acts in multiple forms. Base on the related example in code, the “Shape” type has a behavior of “Draw” but because of being abstract each child of it can have its custom way for drawing. So, the request is the same to draw each shape but the body of the “Draw” function would be different for each of the Shape’s children.
 	
The sample code may help for understanding the concept better.
